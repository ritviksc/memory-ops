# memory-ops
A overview of how memory works in a system with my insights and examples.
You can read my [article on memory alignment](https://github.com/ritviksc/memory-ops/blob/main/Memory-Alignment/alignment.md) which uses memcpy as a case-study  
[memcpy1](memcpy1.c) is my implementation of glibc memcpy  
You can run the benchmarks provided to see the difference bewteen standard implementations
